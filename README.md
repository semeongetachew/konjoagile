## 👥 Team Roles & Responsibilities

Agile teams thrive when each member clearly understands their role and contributes to a shared purpose.  

- **Product Owner:** Defines the vision, prioritizes the backlog, and ensures the team delivers value to customers.  
- **Scrum Master / Agile Coach:** Facilitates team processes, removes roadblocks, and fosters continuous improvement.  
- **Development Team:** Self-organizing professionals who design, build, test, and deliver working software.  
- **Stakeholders:** Provide feedback, clarify requirements, and align expectations with the team’s progress.

## 🤝 Conflict Resolution

In Agile environments, conflicts can arise due to differing perspectives, priorities, or communication gaps. Healthy conflict resolution encourages collaboration and continuous improvement.

**Tips for resolving conflicts effectively:**
- Listen actively
- Focus on goals, not blame
- Use retrospectives
- Encourage transparency
- Involve facilitators

By addressing conflicts constructively, teams can strengthen trust, improve communication, and maintain momentum toward their goals.

## 🔁 Retrospectives

Retrospectives are a core Agile ceremony that allow teams to inspect and adapt their processes.  

**Common formats:**
- Start, Stop, Continue  
- Mad, Sad, Glad  
- 4Ls — Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed for  

**Best practices:**
- Keep discussions constructive and action-oriented.  
- Celebrate wins, no matter how small.  
- Turn insights into clear, actionable items for the next sprint.

- **Extreme Programming (XP):** Focuses on technical excellence through TDD, pair programming, and continuous integration.  
- **Lean:** Derived from manufacturing, Lean aims to maximize value and minimize waste.
